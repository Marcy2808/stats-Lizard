# Regression Analysis on Lizard dataset 🦎

The Draco flying lizard, scientifically known as Draco volans, is a species of lizard capable of gliding through the air. These lizards belong to the family Agamidae and are native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Dracos reach about 8 inches long, including tail. They have flattened bodies, which also aid in flight, and are a mottled brown in color. The undersides of their wings are blue in males and yellow in females. They also have a flap of skin on the bottom of their necks called a dewlap. This is bright yellow in males and bluish gray in females. The flying lizard is found mainly in rain forests and tropical areas that can provide adequate number of trees for the lizard to jump from.

In this report, we are going to investigate data from Draco's individuals living on 100 Malayan achipelago, where each row corresponds to an island.

## Data

Individuals of a species of flying lizards (Draco sp.) on 100 islands in the Malayan archipelago. Each row corresponds to an island, which consists of records collected in plots of 1 × 1 km (i.e. 1 km) on each island. The first variable counts contains the number of flying lizards found on these plots.
